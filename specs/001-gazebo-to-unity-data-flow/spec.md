### User Story 3 - Handling Synchronization Challenges (Priority: P3)

As a system architect, I want to understand the synchronization challenges in Gazebo-Unity data flow so that I can design appropriate solutions to maintain temporal consistency between physics and visualization.

**Why this priority**: This addresses a critical technical challenge that impacts the reliability of the integrated system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by understanding the synchronization mechanisms and challenges between the two platforms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a need for synchronized physics and visualization, **When** implementing the data flow, **Then** I can identify and address timing discrepancies between Gazebo and Unity
