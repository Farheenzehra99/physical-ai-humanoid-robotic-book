## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the specification for the Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim. The specification explains what NVIDIA Isaac Sim is in beginner-friendly terms, covers photorealistic simulation capabilities, explains AI-powered robot training features, describes the sim-to-real concept, includes the requested conceptual diagram (Gazebo → Isaac Sim → Real Robot), includes the requested bullet list of key features, uses professional yet beginner-friendly language with headings, bullets, and diagrams, and maintains the requested 1.5-2 page length.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Isaac Sim introduction, ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all requirements are met
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to design implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all requested aspects including photorealistic simulation, AI training, and sim-to-real concepts

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
