## Prompt

/sp.specify

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Chapter 6: Integrating Gazebo & Unity Simulations
Page 18: "Example: Humanoid Navigation Simulation"

Style & Tone:
- Step-by-step conceptual scenario:
  - Gazebo: physics and sensors
  - Unity: visualization and debugging
  - Robot navigates through obstacles
- Keep beginner-friendly, use bullets/diagrams
- Length: 1.5 pages

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the specification for the humanoid navigation simulation example. The specification provides a step-by-step conceptual scenario of humanoid navigation, explains Gazebo's role in physics simulation and sensor modeling, covers Unity's role in visualization and debugging, describes how the robot navigates through obstacles, includes beginner-friendly explanations with visual elements, and maintains the requested 1.5-page length.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for humanoid navigation simulation example, ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all requirements are met
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to design implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all requested aspects including physics, sensors, visualization, and debugging

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
