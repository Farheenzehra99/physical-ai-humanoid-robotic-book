## Prompt

/sp.specify

Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Chapter 13: Capstone Project
Page 34: "Scenario: Voice Command → Object Manipulation"

Style & Tone:
- Step-by-step conceptual example:
  - Voice command
  - LLM planning
  - Navigation & obstacle avoidance
  - Object recognition
  - Manipulation
- Include flowchart/diagram + bullets + mini pseudo-code
- Length: 1.5 pages

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the specification for Scenario: Voice Command → Object Manipulation. The specification explains the step-by-step conceptual example starting from voice command in beginner-friendly terms, covers LLM planning for the requested task, describes navigation and obstacle avoidance to reach the target, explains object recognition for proper identification, covers manipulation for executing the physical action, includes a flowchart/diagram, bullets, and mini pseudo-code, and maintains the requested 1.5 page length.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for voice command to object manipulation scenario, ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all requirements are met
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to design implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all requested aspects including voice processing, planning, navigation, recognition, and manipulation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
