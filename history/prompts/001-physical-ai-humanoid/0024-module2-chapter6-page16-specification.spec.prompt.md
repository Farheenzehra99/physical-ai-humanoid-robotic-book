## Prompt

/sp.specify

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Chapter 6: Integrating Gazebo & Unity Simulations
Page 16: "Why Integrate Gazebo and Unity?"

Style & Tone:
- Explain benefits:
  - Physics accuracy (Gazebo) + Visual fidelity (Unity)
  - Realistic training environments
  - Multi-robot interaction
- Include simple diagram idea
- Length: 1.5 pages

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the specification for the Gazebo-Unity integration feature. The specification addresses the feature description by explaining the benefits of combining Gazebo's physics accuracy with Unity's visual fidelity, covering realistic training environments, addressing multi-robot interaction capabilities, including requirements for a simple integration diagram, and maintaining the requested 1.5-page length.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for Gazebo-Unity integration benefits, ready for planning phase
- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates all requirements are met
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created in feature directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to design implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all requested aspects including physics accuracy, visual fidelity, training environments, and multi-robot interaction

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
