# Weekly Schedule to Module/Chapter Mapping

This document provides the mapping between the 13-week schedule and the module/chapter structure for reference purposes only. This mapping is separate from the directory structure, which maintains the pure Module → Chapter → Page organization.

## Week-by-Week Mapping

| Week | Module | Chapter | Topic |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Week 1 | Module 1 | Chapter 1 | ROS2 Foundations & Nervous System |
| Week 2 | Module 1 | Chapter 2 | Python Agents & ROS Integration |
| Week 3 | Module 1 | Chapter 3 | URDF Design for Humanoids |
| Week 4 | Module 2 | Chapter 4 | Gazebo Physics Simulation |
| Week 5 | Module 2 | Chapter 5 | Unity Rendering & Visualization |
| Week 6 | Module 3 | Chapter 7 | Isaac Sim SDK & Physics |
| Week 7 | Module 3 | (Additional Chapter) | Reinforcement Learning in Isaac Sim |
| Week 8 | Module 3 | (Additional Chapter) | Vision-Language-Action Models |
| Week 9 | Module 3 | (Additional Chapter) | Unity Integration |
| Week 10 | Module 4 | (Chapter TBA) | TensorRT Optimization |
| Week 11 | Module 4 | (Chapter TBA) | Jetson Deployment |
| Week 12 | Module 4 | (Chapter TBA) | Hardware Integration |
| Week 13 | Module 4 | (Chapter TBA) | Sim-to-Real Transfer & Capstone |

## Directory Structure (Current)

The actual directory structure maintains the pure Module → Chapter → Page hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── module-01-foundations/
│   ├── chapter-01-ros2-nervous-system/
│   ├── chapter-02-python-agents-ros/
│   └── chapter-03-urdf-humanoids/
├── module-02-digital-twin/
│   ├── chapter-04-gazebo-physics-simulation/
│   └── chapter-05-unity-rendering/
├── module-03-ai-robot-brain/
│   └── chapter-07-isaac-sim-sdk/
└── module-04-hardware-integration/
    └── (chapters to be added)
```

This separation ensures:
- Clean, hierarchical organization by modules and chapters
- Easy navigation and content management
- Flexible scheduling that can be adjusted without restructuring content
- Clear academic progression from foundations to advanced topics
